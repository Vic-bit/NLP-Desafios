Papercut
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within (I feel the light betray me)

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
(It's like) It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

One Step Closer
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]Just like before[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]Everything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeI'm about to breakEverything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to break[Bridge: Chester Bennington]Shut up when I'm talking to youShut up, shut up, shut upShut up when I'm talking to youShut up, shut up, shut up, shut upI'm about to break[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]Everything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeI'm about to breakEverything you say to meTakes me one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to breakI need a little room to breathe'Cause I'm one step closer to the edgeAnd I'm about to break

With You
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot about yesterday, remembering
I'm pretendin' to be who I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
And even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come, I
I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
With you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)

Points of Authority
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
You love to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)


Crawling
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real





[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing




This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem





[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in




Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real





[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (Distracting), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
It's haunting (It's haunting) how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in




Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real




Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal




Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

Confusing what is real



[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming)

Runaway Lyrics
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Graffiti decorations under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension on top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me, I learned were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action, these words were never true

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Gonna run away, gonna run away
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind!
Gonna run away, gonna run away
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)
Mind! (Gonna run away, gonna run away)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind
I wanna run away and open up my mind






(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)

By Myself
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade, but then
I just end up gettin' hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch 'em, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself!), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Don't you know!?
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside, don't you know?!
I can't tell you how to make it go!
No matter what I do, how hard I try!
I can't seem to convince myself why!
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watchin' everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking


In the End
[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter


A Place for My Head
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors, then rapidly
You just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Maybe someday, I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome, and now you see
How quiet it is all alone
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
You try to take the best of me, go away!
[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Stay away!
I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Stay!)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (A!)
While I find a place to rest
And I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Way!)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Stay away from me!)
While I find a place to rest



Forgotten
[Intro: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There's a place so dark, you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) And shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut, lookin' through the rust and rot, and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open, and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
In the memory, you will find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up


Pushing Me Away
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Pushes me away


[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me, alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
(And I) Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
(And I) Take back all the things
That I said to you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to
Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to


METEORA

Don’t Stay
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes, I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need you to go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stay

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes, I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need to be alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda & Both]
(Don't stay) Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and don't stayI don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
(With no apologies)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealin' second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I oughta be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And now, you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth
But the more I push, the more I'm pullin' away
'Cause I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this, this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this (This) this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this (This) this isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me
Like this
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You
(No turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think havin' the upper hand means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won, and then it's all gone

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall, and I'm countin' down the time
'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won
[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone


[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Something has been taken from deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away, no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show, they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they've played

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone
[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's easier to run
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go
If I could change, I would, take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
I would take all my shame to the grave


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

[Breakdown: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored


[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nothin' ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Never goes away
Never goes away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hearin' your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committin' myself to 'em and every day
I regret sayin' those things 'cause now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Never goes away
Never goes away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, Both]
Never goes away
Never goes away
It never goes away
It never goes away (Get away from me)
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go)
Everything comes down to memories of (You)
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know)
I've let you go, so get away from me
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go)
Everything comes down to memories of (You)
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know)
I've let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you



[Verse 1]
Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight


[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Tryin' not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Tryin' not to break, but I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet
(I) All I ever think about is this, all the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I won't waste myself on you, you, you
Waste myself on you, you, you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away
'Cause I swear, for the last time
I won't trust myself with you, you, you


[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Com-com-com-com-comin' at you
Com—, at you, com-comin' at you

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, peep the style and the kids checkin' for it
The number one question is "How could you ignore it?"
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backin' this up like "Rewind that"
We're just rollin' with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life livin'
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime, there are those
Who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreadin' the dirt, it ​goes

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone else's more
I'm ridin' on the back of this pressure
Guessin' that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me somethin' to write on
The pain gave me somethin' I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear
And trash-talkin' and the people it was to
And the people that started it, just like you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothin' to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nothin' to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening

[Breakdown: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat, and tears
Nobody's listening
Nothin' to gain, everything to fear
Nobody's listening

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Com-com-com-com-comin' at you
Com-comin', comin', comin', comin' at you
Com-comin', come-com-comin' at
Com-com-com-com-comin' at you from every side



[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

Minutes to midnight

Given up

[Verse 1]
Wake in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy

[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Verse 2]
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Lookin' for help somehow, somewhere, and no one cares

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy

[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

[Breakdown]
God!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my, put me out of my
Fucking misery!

[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

Leave Out All the Rest
[Verse 1]
I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen, 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?

[Pre-Chorus]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating, I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect, but neither have you

[Pre-Chorus]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
[Bridge]
Forgetting all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

[Chorus]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Outro]
Forgetting all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are

Bleed It Out
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Goin' out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this!
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Shadow of the day

[Verse 1]
I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

[Chorus]
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

[Verse 2]
In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you

[Chorus]
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in gray
And the sun will set for you

[Instrumental Outro]

What I've done

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
For what I've done, I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)

Hands Held High
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say somethin'
Lightweights step it aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumpin'
People on the street, they panic and start runnin'
Words on loose-leaf sheet complete comin'
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme I'm dumpin'
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin'
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin'
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumpin'
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say somethin' that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standin' for what I'm standin' for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank and cashin' the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect

[Refrain: Mike Shinoda]
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
In the livin' room laughin', like, "What did he say?"
[Chorus: Choir]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
In my livin' room watching, but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old, something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"
[Refrain: Mike Shinoda]
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watchin', at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like, "What did he say?"

[Chorus: Choir]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington, Choir]
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)
With hands held high into a sky so blue (Amen)
As the ocean opens up to swallow you (Amen)

No more sorrow

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm aware of what you've done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You will pay for what you've done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced!

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased!

Valentine’s Day
[Verse 1]
My insides all turned to ash, so slow
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
A black wind took them away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night

[Chorus]
And the clouds above move closer, lookin' so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

[Verse 2]
I used to be my own protection, but not now
'Cause my path has lost direction, somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
A black wind took you away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night

[Chorus]
And the clouds above move closer, lookin' so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder as they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

[Bridge]
So now you're gone, and I was wrong
I never knew what it was like to be alone
[Outro]
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)

In Between
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But tryin' to be genuine was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But tryin' to be someone else was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I wanna say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But tryin' to regain your trust was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I wanna say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And I cannot explain to you in anything I say or do or plan
Fear is not afraid of you, but guilt's a language you can understand
I cannot explain to you, in anything I say or do
I hope the actions speak the words they can

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
For my pride and my promise
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I wanna say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is...
Pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I wanna say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none

In pieces

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Telling me to go
But hands beg me to stay
Your lips say that you love
Your eyes say that you hate

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
What you build, you lay to waste
There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You promise me the sky
Then toss me like a stone
You wrap me in your arms
And chill me to the bone

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
There's truth in your lies, doubt in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this in pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets and regrets, don't lie

The little things give you away

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean, everywhere

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater
I do

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater
I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground now
I, now I do

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
The little things give you away (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
The little things give you away (Oh-oh)
The little things give you away (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
The little things give you away (Oh)
All you've ever wanted (The little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (The little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (The little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (The little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (The little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (The little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (The little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (The little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (The little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (The little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (The little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (The little things give you away)

No roads left

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Standing alone with no direction
How did I fall so far behind?
Why am I searching for perfection
Knowing it's something I won't find?

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When did I lose my sense of purpose?
Can I regain what's lost inside?
Why do I feel like I deserve this?
Why does my pain look like my pride? Oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because I let myself down
In my fear and flaws

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one
No roads left but one

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run and the silence splits me open
I run and it puts me underground
But there's no regret
And no roads left to run

Across the Line
[Verse 1]
In this desert, in darkness
Lying with the gun across his chest
Pretending he's heartless
As the fire flashes in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
He was fragile and frozen
When the bullet took away his friend
And now he's somehow more broken

[Chorus]
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Verse 2]
Sweating and shaking
Lying with her hands across her chest
She wakes with her cravings
As the fire flashes in her eye

[Pre-Chorus]
She was fragile and frozen
When the needle took away her friend
But now she's somehow more broken
[Chorus]
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Bridge]
With every battle he's choosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind
With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

[Breakdown]
It's your time
It's your time
It's your time
It's your time!

[Chorus]
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

[Outro]
With every battle he's choosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind
With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

A Thousand suns

The requiem 

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young
(Four, three, two, one)

The radiance 

[J. Robert Oppenheimer]
We knew the world would not be the same
Few people laughed
Few people cried
Most people were silent
I remember the line from The Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
And, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says:
"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another

Burning in the Skies
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the risin' of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris
Oh

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve, what I don't deserve

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end, we were made to be apart
Like separate chambers of the human heart
No

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm swimming in the smoke of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve
It's in the blackened bones of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize, I'm losing what I don't deserve, what I don't deserve

[Guitar Solo]

Empty spaces
[Intro]
*explosions and callouts*

[Interlude: Brad Delson]
"Todos los pelotones, presten atención ahora mismo!"

When They Come for Me
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person tellin' you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
Y'all ought to stop talkin', start tryin' to catch up, motherfucker

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And all the people say
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Try to catch up, motherfucker
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Lauryn said, "Money change a situation"
Big said, "It increase the complication"
Kane said, "Don't step, I ain't the one"
Chuck said, "That Uzi weigh a motherfuckin' ton"
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rockin' every stage in every place that it brought me
I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'ma state it for the record
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak, opposite of slack
Synonym of heat, synonym of crack
Closest to a peak, far from a punk
Y'all ought to stop talkin', start tryin' to catch up, motherfucker

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And all the people say
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Try to catch up, motherfucker
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Oh, when they come for me, come for me, I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me, come for me, I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me, come for me, I'll be gone
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And all the people say
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Try to catch up, motherfucker
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
And all the people say
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Try to catch up, motherfucker
Woah-oh, oh, woah-oh, oh

[Outro: Brad Delson & Chester Bennington]
Escuchénme, preste atención
Escuchénme ahora, escuchénme ahora
Escuchénme todos
Toda la gente, preste atención
Escuchénme ahora mismo
Eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh

Robot Boy
[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you
And you think there's not enough love and no one to give it to
And you're sure you've hurt for so long, you've got nothing left to lose
So, you say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You say the weight of the world has kept you from letting go (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And you think compassion's a flaw and you'll never let it show (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And you're sure you've hurt in a way that no one will ever know (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But someday the weight of the world will give you the strength to go (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Oh, woah-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, da, yeah-nah, no, ooh-oh
No, no

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
Hold on, the weight of the world (Na, no, no, no, no oh)
(Oh-ho, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Yeah, yeah, ah)
(Yeah, no)
So hold on, the weight of the world (Yeah-ah, yeah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Nah, ha, ha, ha, no, no; Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
So hold on, the weight of the world (Ah, yeah)
Will give you the strength to go (Mah-mah-mah)
[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Just hold on, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

Jornada del muerto
[Intro]
Mochiagete, tokihanashite
Mochiagete, tokihanashite
Mochiagete, tokihanashite
Mochiagete, tokihanashite

Waiting for the End
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginnin'
Just a voice like a riot rockin' every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, somethin' empty's within 'em
We say, "Yeah," with fists flyin' up in the air
Like we're holdin' onto somethin' that's invisible there
'Cause we're livin' at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Oh, oh-oh) I know what it takes to move on
(Oh, oh-oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
(Oh) Holding on to what I haven't got
[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Sitting in an empty room
Tryin' to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Oh, oh-oh) I know what it takes to move on
(Oh, oh-oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
(Oh) Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Yo, yo
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And tryin' to figure out what it's like movin' on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept movin' and my mind went dead
So I'm pickin' up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of endin' is startin' again (Oh-oh)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All, all, a-a-a-a-all
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got
[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rockin' every revision
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady, somethin' empty's within 'em
Yeah
We say, "Yeah," with fists flyin' up in the air
Like we're holdin' onto somethin' that's invisible there
Holding on to what I haven't got
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

Blackout
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies, how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough, you take
And take and take and never say

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breakin'
You run but then back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're makin'
You can't get enough, you take
And take, and take, and take, and take
Fuck it, are you listening?
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Blackout, blood in your eye
You push it back down, push it back down
You push it back down, blood in your eye
Blackout, blackout, blackout, blood in your eye
Blackout, black-bla-black-blackout
Blood in your—
Black-blackout, blackout, black-blackout
Blackout, blood in your eye
(Blackout, blood in your eye)
(Blackout, blood in your eye)
(Blackout, blood in your eye)
(Blackout, blood in your eye)
(Blackout, blood in your eye)
(Blackout)
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paper white
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh

Wretches and Kings
[Intro: Mario Savio]
There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part, you can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you've got to make it stop

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
To save face, how low can you go?
Talk a lotta game but yet you don't know
Static on the way, make us all say, "Woah"
The people up top push the people down low
Get down and obey every word
Steady gettin' mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet, then I'm lettin' you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control, now everybody go

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lotta shit and yet you don't know
Fire on the way, make you all say, "Whoa"
The people up top and the people down low
Get down, and I'm runnin' it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' 'em know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no
So push the button, let the whole thing blow
Spinnin' everything outta control, now everybody go

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Steel unload, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you
Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel, put 'em up real high

[Outro: Mario Savio]
When the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part, you can't even passively take part
And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you've got to make it stop
And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
That unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all

Linkin Park – Iridescent
The band’s fourth and final single off A Thousand Suns. It’s a “rock ballad about HOPE amongst chaos and sadness” according to the band. This is further amplified by the song title “Iridescent” itself as it means the formation of rainbow-like patterns on the oil spills or soap bubbles. Since the album is based on war and machines, and rainbow is a symbol of hope, the song’s motive becomes clear as in it wants to invoke feelings of positivity amidst the negativity and chaos.

Joe Hahn, the band’s turntablist, who directed the video a year later said, in a one-line description of the video’s concept,
‘In the valley of the blind, the one-eyed man is king’

The song was also used as the theme song for the third Transformers film, keeping in tradition with the previous two contributions that the band has made to the franchise, namely “What I’ve Done” and “New Divide”.

In addition to the official music video, Linkin Park, in association with Stars of the season released a second music video for the song which is aimed at raising awareness for pediatric oncology. Frontman Chester Bennington has also signed on as co-chair of the foundation.

Fallout
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm swimmin' in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losin' what I don't deserve
The blame is mine alone
For bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losin' what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

The Catalyst
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
God bless us, everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no!
God bless us, everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought, it can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched, it can't be outrun, no

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young? No!
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand, the sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young? No

The messenger
[Verse 1]
When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world
Your instincts telling you to run
Listen to your heart, those angel voices
They'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home

[Chorus]
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind, it keeps us kind

[Verse 2]
When you've suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember you're loved and you always will be
This melody will bring you right back home

[Chorus]
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

New divide
[Verse 1]
I remembered black skies, the lightning all around me
I remembered each flash as time began to blur
Like a startling sign that fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard that at I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
All across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight, but memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide, the ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
All across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss, in every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
All across this new divide
All across this new divide
All across this new divide

Living Things

LOST IN THE ECHO
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see
(Oh-oh-oh) That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell
(Oh-oh-oh) There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best, they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, sayin'

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that workin' out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that, frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back, unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
(Oh-oh-oh) So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
(Oh-oh-oh) I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, sayin'

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go!

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Go, go)
(Go, go)
(Go, go)
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, sayin'

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you (Go!) go, (Go!) go, (Go!) go, (Go!) go
(Go!) Go, (Go!) go, (Go!) go

IN MY REMAINS
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Come apart
Falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Like an army falling
One by one by one
Like an army falling
One by one by one
Like an army falling
One by one by one
Like an army falling
One by one by one

Burn it down
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

CASTLE OF GLASS
Linkin Park
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

LIES GREED MISERY
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I'ma be that n-n-n-na-na-nail in your coffin, sayin' that I softened?
I was duckin' down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations, I don't have the patience
Before you even say it, I know
You le-l-l-let your pride or you ego talk slick to me? No
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure, now let me show you
Exactly how the breakin' point sounds

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
What is it you want me to tell you? I'm not the failure
I would rather live and let be
But you came with the right kind of threat to push me to let you
Know you can't intimidate me
You di-di-disrespect me so clearly, now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over, now let me show you
Exactly how the breakin' point sounds
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
I wanna see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself! You did it to yourself!
You did it to yourself! You did it to yourself!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna see you choke on your lies! Swallow up your greed!
Suffer all alone in your misery!
Choke on your lies! Swallow up your greed!
Suffer all alone in your misery!

I'll be gone
[Verse 1]
Like shining oil, this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I'm tryin' not to think what I'm leaving now
No deceiving now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time you let me know
Let me know

[Chorus]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

[Verse 2]
This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now, bittersweet
And 'cross that horizon, this sun is setting down
You're forgetting now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time you let me go
Let me go

[Chorus]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone

[Bridge]
And tell them I couldn't help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing that can stop me

[Chorus]
When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone (I'll be gone)

Castle of GLASS
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see, for you to see

VICTIMIZED
[Intro: Indonesian T-shirt vendor]
One, only one, throw it back here
[?]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Victimized! Victimized!
Never again victimized!
Victimized! Victimized!
Never again victimized!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give 'em
As the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplyin' the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
You been waitin' in the shadows there, thinkin' you're hidden
But the truth is, you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit 'em, yeah, you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim? I'mma put you there with 'em

ROADS UNTRAVELED
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Give up your heart, left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time, you'll be glad it's gone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

SKIN TO BONE 
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Let tomorrow have its way with the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Skin to bone and steel to rust

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to grey, I'll be marchin' far away
Right to left and left to right

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Skin to bone and steel to rust

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Let tomorrow have its way
With the promises betrayed
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust

UNTIL IT BREAKS
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
It goes a one, two, three

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put 'em both together, now tell me what I got, it's
A pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it like that

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
It ain't over 'cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes
But steady, little soldier, I ain't standin' next to you
I'd be layin' on the ground before you're even in my view like that

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing, "Bring me to kingdom come"
[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
It's something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give me what you need like Poppa, who shot you?
"Separate the weak from the obsolete"
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on a dime, quick-witted
Y'all quit trippin', I don't have time for your cryin'
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firin' squad or are you in the lineup?
Bang, bang, little monkey man, playin' with the big guns
Only get you slain, I ain't playin', I'm just sayin'
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank takedown
And no mistakes now, I'm comin' to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a brainwash
Get the picture? It's like that

[Outro: Brad Delson]
We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more
So rest your head, it's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more

POWERLESS
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Verse 2]
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Outro]
Powerless
Powerless

THE HAUNTING PARTY

Keys to the Kingdom
[Intro: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility
Ah, da-da, da-da

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We start the final war
Tell me what's worth fighting for when we know there's nothing more
We take the hand or fist
Just to sell ourselves for this, the path we least resist

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Ah, I give you what you came for, this is not the same though
Got a different method, but I still can bring the pain, so
Y'all all get that same flow, I got that insane flow
High as y'all can get, you're never really in my range, though
Yes, I'm half Anglo, half-fried panko
All prime-time rhymer, let the bass bang low
All you fuckin' lames go aimin' at my name, know
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh) No control, no surprise
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh) Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh) I'm my own casualty
I'm my own casualty

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
"I'm not allowed to say certain things. Ah!"
Try and do...try and do the other thing, real quick

All for Nothing
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah
Ah, so what'cha waitin' for, anticipatin' more
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fuckin' say they didn't say before
But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
While you're waitin' for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like "one, two, three, four"

[Chorus: Page Hamilton & Chester Bennington]
And if I do what you demand (You say)
You'll let me understand (You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away (You say)
I'll have no debt to pay (You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve, woah-oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Page Hamilton]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing, all for nothing

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya, I really don't know ya
You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
You're jokin', I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you
I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you
And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not takin' any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show you, have you checkin' your composure
While I make you step to it like "one, two, three, four"?

Guilty All the Same
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
But oh-oh, we all know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Show us all again, that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again, 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And oh-oh, you will know
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same

[Post-Chorus]
Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

[Bridge: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of bein' rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split, nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as the dough or the deal peak
Say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Drained, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock 'til pop and radio
And record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see
That green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game
To me you're all the same, you're guilty
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same

[Post-Chorus]
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

[Instrumental Outro]

THE SUMMONING
[Instrumental]

[Spoken]
"Watch the ball."
"Everybody get ready."
"Nice!"
"Run, run, run run!"

WAR
[Intro]
(One, two, one, two, thank you)

[Verse 1]
There's no peace, only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease, only grow
You better be prepared to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And it will not apologize
For layin' down your life

[Chorus]
War!

[Verse 2]
There's no pain it will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you're lost, in your despair
Forever black eternal night

[Pre-Chorus]
And it will not apologize
For layin' down your life

[Chorus]
War, destroyer
War, destroyer!

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
It needs no side to justify
Layin' down your life

[Chorus]
War, destroyer
War!

Wastelands
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Ah
This is war with no weapons, marchin' with no steppin'
Murder with no killin', illin' every direction
First, no sequel, do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko; more power, less people
And no, I'm not afraid of that, print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact to act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade that's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave 'em layin' on the pavement, bang, fade to black

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today when there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take, but you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away and your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Roll credits, you get it, the show is done
They're talkin' for just talkin', but meaning, they got none
None of 'em come proper, they talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity? Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today when there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take, but you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away and your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear in the wastelands of today

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today when there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take, but you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away and your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear in the wastelands of today

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today
In the wastelands of today

UNTIL IT'S GONE
[Verse 1]
A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a glow
I've heard it said a thousand times
But now I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got

[Chorus]
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

[Verse 2]
I thought I kept you safe and sound
I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize
That I was wrong
'Cause finding what you've got sometimes
Means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light
When I let go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you don't know what you've got

[Chorus]
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

[Bridge]
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

[Chorus]
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh, you don't know what you've got
No, you don't know what you've got
It's your battle to be fought
No, you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone!
[Instrumental Outro]

REBELLION
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood, I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We acted out, we wear the colors
Confined by the things we own
We're not without, we're like each other
Pretending we're here alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And far away, they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion, rebellion
Rebellion, rebellion

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Rebellion, rebellion
We lost before the start
Rebellion, rebellion
One by one, we fall apart
We fall apart, we fall apart, we fall apart

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of, imitations of
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion, rebellion
Rebellion, rebellion

MARK THE GRAVES 
[Instrumental Intro]

[Interlude: Brad Delson]
(One, two, three, four…)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's a fragile game we play with the ghosts of yesterday
If we can't let go, we'll never say goodbye
No trace of what remains, no stones to mark the graves
Only memories we thought we could deny

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
There was so much more to lose than the pain I put you through
In my carelessness, I left you in the dark
And the blood may wash away, but the scars will never fade
At least I know somehow I made a mark

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right!

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Nothing right!
Nothing right!
Ah!

Final Masquerade
[Verse 1]
Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason, and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

[Chorus]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade, the final masquerade

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime
And we both keep on waitin' for what we left behind

[Chorus]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

[Post-Chorus]
The final masquerade, the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Standing at the end of the final masquerade
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Standing at the end of the final masquerade (Oh-oh-oh), the final masquerade
(Oh-oh-oh)

A Line in the Sand
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns, we laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time, but little did we know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Today, I looked for a sign with flames in my hands
A line in the sand between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall, but little did you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, "Give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine!"

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood
You'd sold me an ocean and I was lost in the flood
We were countin' on a leader, we were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper, we were waitin' on a wire
So we never saw it comin' when you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation, and you can try to ignore
But when the time comes callin', yeah, you are gonna get yours
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, "Give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine!"

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And so today, your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give me, give me back what's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine, what's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine, what's mine, what's mine
Give me back what's mine!

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns, we laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time, but little did we know

ONE MORE LIGHT
NOBODY CAN SAVE Me
[Verse 1]
I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake now

[Chorus]
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Verse 2]
Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Headfirst hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now

[Chorus]
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Bridge]
Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here
(I wanna fall wide awake now)
I've been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here
I wanna fall wide awake now

[Chorus]
So tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven tonight
And only I can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
And I don't wanna let you down
But only I can save me

[Outro]
Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here

Good Goodbye
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Talking to Myself
[Verse 1]
Tell me what I've gotta do
There's no getting through to you
The lights are on, but nobody's home (Nobody's home)
You say I can't understand
But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)

[Pre-Chorus]
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus]
And the truth is
You turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know
I'm just talking to myself (Ooh)
Talking to myself (Ooh)
Talking to myself (Ooh)
But I know, yeah, I know, yeah, I know
I'm just talking to myself

[Verse 2]
I admit I made mistakes
But yours might cost you everything
Can't you hear me calling you home? (Calling you home)

Battle Symphony
[Verse 1]
I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

[Verse 2]
They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

[Pre-Chorus]
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

[Bridge]
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

INVISIBLE 
[Intro]
(Invisible)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible
I won't let you feel that now

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
You didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling
You've got a lot to say
And you just want to know you're being heard
But this is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible
I won't let you feel that now

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Bridge]
(Invisible)
This is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible
I won't let you feel that now

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Outro]
(Invisible)
(Invisible)

HEAVY
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can't escape the gravity

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Chorus: Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Bridge: Chester Bennington, Kiiara & Both]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?

Sorry for Now
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Watching the wings cut through the clouds
Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
Thinking of you back on the ground
There with a fire burning in your eyes
I only halfway apologized

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned
Oh, I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
(—Stand)
(You will under—)
(—Stand)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
After a while you may forget
But just in case the memories cross your mind
You couldn't know this when I left
Under the fire of your angry eyes
I never wanted to say goodbye

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned
Oh, I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
Tried to call home but nobody could wait up
Switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
I just passed out by the time you wake up
Best things come to those who wait
And it's bound to get rough on any road you take
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh, I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
Oh, I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
(Things we have to do that we can't stand)
Oh, I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand
You will understand
You will understand

Halfway Right
[Intro]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

[Verse 1]
Used to get high with the dead-end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows lived
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn't see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an empty vow
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
I knew I took it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

[Chorus]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (Halfway right)
[Verse 2]
Told me, "Kid, you're going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last"
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

[Pre-Chorus]
All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

[Chorus]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right, halfway right

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
But I was already gone
[Chorus]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
But I was already gone

[Outro]
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

ONE MORE LIGHT 
[Verse 1]
Should've stayed, were there signs I ignored?
Can I help you not to hurt anymore?
We saw brilliance when the world was asleep
There are things that we can have but can't keep

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do

[Verse 2]
The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there

[Chorus]
If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do

[Bridge]
(I do)

[Chorus]
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In the sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do
Well, I do

SHARP EDGES
[Verse 1]
Mama always told me don't you run
"Don't you run with scissors, son
You're gonna hurt someone"
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak
And watch the friends you keep

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path
Never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Verse 2]
Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am
Put your nose in paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path
Never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

[Bridge]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay along the beaten path
Never listened when she said

[Chorus]
Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell
[Outro]
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

METEORA (20TH ANIVERSARTY)
Lost Lyrics
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Just a scar somewhere down inside of me
Something I can not repair
Even though it will always be
I pretend it isn't there (This is how I feel)
I'm trapped in yesterday (Just a memory)
Where the pain is all I know (This is all I know)

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
And I'll never break away (Can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
But I'm tired, I will always be afraid
Of the damage I've received
Broken promises they made
And how blindly I believed (This is all I know)

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I will never break away (Can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone

FIGHTING Myself
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
​​​(ti stnaw eno on ,siht ot neppah reven ll'ti ,ti stnaw eno oN)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud
Every little thing that I think about
Just builds on top of the pain and doubt
Even though I wanna just let it out
I try to act like I don't mind it, try to keep my mouth so quiet
But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it
When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better (ti stnaw eno oN)
I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
But every time I think I got everything put back together (ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily (ti stnaw eno oN)
I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
Now I don't know how it overflowed, spilled out unwillingly (ti stnaw eno oN)
But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see
I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better (ti stnaw eno oN)
'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever (siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
And every time you think you got everything put back together (ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
​​​(ti stnaw eno on ,siht ot neppah reven ll'ti ,ti stnaw eno oN)

[Bridge: Both, Mike Shinoda]
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside me
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside of me

[Outro: Chester Bennington, Both, Mike Shinoda]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside of me
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside of me

MORE THE VICTIM
[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
I've— I've— I've— I've—

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've listened endlessly to your injury
You wanna talk about your sores?
You wanna talk about suffering?
Maybe sympathy is all you're really hungry for
'Cause you just criticize and you fingerpoint
And you say that they beat you down
You may be victimized, but you're still the one
Who won't just get up off the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I used to be as innocent as you
My excuses ran out, ran out of things to complain about
Fear will always find a way to show right through

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
You want to say you're more thе victim

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You— You wanna— You— You— You wanna— You—
You— You wanna— You— You—

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
You wanna talk constantly about misery
And how you've been done so wrong
You wanna bеnd your honesty and exaggerate
With the stress that you've undergone
There's never a compromise, no one can say
That they've ever been hurt before
They may be victimized, but you'll always say
That you're a victim so much more

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I used to be as innocent as you
My excuses ran out, ran out of things to complain about
Fear will always find a way to show right through

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
You want to say you're more the victim

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You wanna be just another someone
Somebody angry, somebody broken
You wanna be that, then be it all alone
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
You want to say you're more the victim

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
Pass the blame, pass the blame

Massive Lyrics
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
The best of you (The best of you)
Never did much for me (Never did much for me)
I guess it's true (I guess it's true)
I can't really change the person you'll be
The least I can do is cut myself free

[Refrain: Mike Shinoda]
I heard your screaming in my dreaming every night
I awaken still mistaking you for right

[Verse 2]
The worst of me (The worst of me)
Will get my best today (Get my best today)
Don't laugh, you'll see (Don't laugh, you'll see)
I'll carefully choose the words that I say
And try to pretend it all is okay

[Chorus]
I heard your scrеaming in my dreaming every night
I awakеn still mistaking you for right
Broke myself and hoped I still could save some face
Now I'm floating, I'm controlling in this state of grace

[Instrumental Bridge]

HEALING FOOT
[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It's safe to say I've always felt this way
Holding back my words again
For fear they're uninvited
Now it's safe to say

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
At this point that I've been wrong and it's all been a mess
I listen to the cars drive by and don't know why that I couldn't have left
But now I'm stuck in the middle of a situation that I made appear
You'd be surprised at how scared of the clarity you could be 'til you see it so clear
But it's like I can't really look at it rationally
Wishing that you could look back at what I see
These things happen, but actually
The things that happen have happened to me
So don't try to tell me it's all okay
I'm reaching for this from too far away
Yesterday's problems here again today, and it's safe to say

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's safe to say I've always felt this way
Holding back my words again
For fear they're uninvited
Now it's safe to say

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
At this point, you've been wrong and it's all been a mess
I placed all the signals out there and don't know why that you couldn't have guessed
And now you're stuck in the middle of a situation that you made so real
And you gotta just play with the cards that you got until it's your turn to deal
But it's like I can't really look at it rationally
Wishing that you could look back at what I see
Everything you ever asked me to be
Is there in the smallest fraction of me
So don't try to tell me it's all okay
You're reaching for this from too far away
Yesterday's problems here again today, and it's safe to say

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's safe to say I've always felt this way
Holding back my words again
For fear they're uninvited
But now it's safe to say

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No more regrets (I slowed them down)
No boundaries left (I've drawn them down)
No asking how (I broke them down)
No stopping now

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's safe to say I've always felt this way
Holding back my words again
For fear they're uninvited
But now it's safe to say
This fear is just a plague
I'm taking back my heart again
No longer undivided
Now it's safe to say
